 # Menu Management Backend 
This is Routes by Tanisha Agrawal
Getting Stared
This project is using Node.js and mongoose framework
## Prerequisites

- Node.js 
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (running locally or accessible)

 ## Installation
 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/Tanisha021/menu-management-routes

cd menu-management-backend

```
## Database Choice

MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility with JSON-like documents, which suited the data structure for menu items, categories, and menus. It integrates well with Node.js and is easy to set up and use.

## Learnings

- **Express.js**: Gained a deeper understanding of building RESTful APIs using Express.js.
- **MongoDB**: Learned how to model data for MongoDB and use Mongoose for data manipulation.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling practices, especially with asynchronous operations in Node.js.

## Most Difficult Part

Implementing filtering for subcategories and items based on specific criteria was challenging, requiring complex queries and careful handling of the data structure.

## Changes with More Time

- **Refactoring**: Would refactor some parts of the code for better readability and maintainability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and overall server performance for scalability.
